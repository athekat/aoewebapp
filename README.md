Web application made with :heart: and Django. The user inputs an Age of Empires II player's ID and the application retrieves information about the current (or last) match. It shows the player's name, elo, color, map, civs chosen and their information and bonuses, using data from [aoe2techtree](https://aoe2techtree.net/).

Deployed using Railway [here](https://aoewebapp-production.up.railway.app/). **EDIT: FREE TRIAL PLAN FINISHED.**

Now deployed using Render [here](https://aoewebapp-2gqr.onrender.com/).
